# ðŸ§  apiPilot â€“ AI-Powered API Tester via MCP

**apiPilot** is an AI-native Postman alternative built with [MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcp), allowing developers to test and interact with APIs using natural language via tools like [Cursor](https://www.cursor.sh).

With apiPilot, just say:
Test the createUser API

...and it will:
- Automatically locate the API endpoint
- Generate a mock request body
- Send a POST request
- Return the full response
- Save the request and response as a reusable collection
